Overview
This is a demo movie streaming platform called "WitFlix" created as part of my Workintech coursework. The project demonstrates front-end development skills using HTML and CSS to create a Netflix-inspired interface.

Fixed navigation header with logo, menu, and user controls

Featured movie section with details and play button

Movie rows for "Popular Movies" and "Recommended for You"

Footer with links, social media, and app download options

Hover effects and interactive elements

Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (with Flexbox and Grid)

Font Awesome icons (though not included in this code)

Responsive design principles

How to Use
Clone or download the repository

Open index.html in a web browser

The page should display the WitFlix interface

Notes
This is a static front-end demo without actual functionality

Placeholder content is used throughout

The design is inspired by streaming platforms like Netflix

Font Awesome icons are referenced but would need to be properly linked to work

Future Improvements
Add JavaScript for interactive features

Connect to a movie database API

Implement user authentication

Add actual movie content and categories
